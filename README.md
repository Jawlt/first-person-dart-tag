# first-person-dart-tag
This is a first-person dart tag game I developed in Unity using C#. The game involves players tagging each other using darts in a dynamic and interactive environment. It features both human and AI-controlled players, a tagging mechanic with projectiles, score tracking, and a 3-minute timer. Additional features include a title screen, in-game pause menu, and a leaderboard. This project allowed me to enhance my skills in game design, object-oriented programming, and managing game mechanics effectively in Unity.

# Unity Game Project

Is based on the Dart Tag, where you have a player and an enemy that had to shoot a dart or bullet to tag eachother.
As the player you have a lot more mobility than the AI, as it very fast in terms of returning "tag" back to you. Animations for idle, walking, and running are applied to the player not the enemyAI.
To restart the game, you will need to wait until the leaderboard is show then procede back to the main menu and from there start a new game.
